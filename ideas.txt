1) Run many randomized parallel solves (multithreaded essentially) 
    - captures randomized restarts 
    - or we could do exponential backtract limit 
2) CDCL (conflict driven clause learning) 
    - vsids ?
3) Parameter search over the test cases


-------------------
2/12
 - fix output to assign unnecessary vars too (just do #t for all)
Mark: - redo UCE to recursively do it for new UCs that open up (still mult at a time)
Mark: - better heuristic (small clauses)
 - look for stupid map/filters
    - run profiler see what takes up time
 - watched literals
 - run test cases through minisat to get ground truth
Neev: - fix solution checker
